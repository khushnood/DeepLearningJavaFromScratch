The Boston House Price Dataset involves the prediction of a house price in thousands of dollars given details of the house and its neighborhood.

It is a regression problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 506 observations with 13 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town.
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: proportion of nonretail business acres per town.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
RM: average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
B: 1000(Bk â€“ 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
LSTAT: % lower status of the population.
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
The baseline performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 9.21 thousand dollars.
