The Ionosphere Dataset requires the prediction of structure in the atmosphere given radar returns targeting free electrons in the ionosphere.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 351 observations with 34 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

17 pairs of radar return data.
â€¦
Class (g for good and b for bad).
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 64%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 94%.
